        <p>
            CBSE Class 10 Science Notes Chapter 1 <strong>Chemical Reactions and Equations</strong> 
            provides a concise summary for quick revision. Key points include balanced and 
            unbalanced equations, characteristics of chemical reactions, and their types.
        </p>

        <h3>What is a Chemical Reaction?</h3>
        <p>
            A chemical reaction involves the transformation of one chemical substance into another. 
            For example, rusting of iron, digestion of food, and respiration are all examples of chemical reactions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reactants:</strong> Substances participating in a reaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Products:</strong> New substances formed during a reaction.</li>
            <li>For example there is reaction of NaOH(Sodium hydroxide) and HCl(Hydrogen chloride) we get NaCl and 
           H<sub>2</sub>O. In this reaction NaOH and HCl are reactant whereas NaCl and Water are products.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Characteristics of Chemical Reactions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Evolution of gas (e.g., zinc with sulfuric acid).</li>
            <li>Change in color (e.g., reaction of citric acid with potassium permanganate).</li>
            <li>Change in state (e.g., combustion of candle wax).</li>
            <li>Change in temperature (e.g., quicklime with water).</li>
            <li>Formation of precipitate (e.g., barium chloride with sulfuric acid).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is a Chemical Equation?</h3>
        <p>
            A chemical equation represents a reaction using symbols of substances. 
            A balanced chemical equation has equal atoms of each element on both sides. It should follow the law 
            of Conservation of mass. 
            <li>For example there is a chemical reaction below  </li>
            <li> CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
            Now on the Reactant side, there is one atom of Carbon, 4 atoms of hydrogen and 2 atoms of 
            Oxygen. But on the other side, there are 3 atoms of oxygen. So we need the same no. of atoms 
            on that side.  So we will use hit and trial method. 
            <li> Here is our balanced equation.</li>
            <li> CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O</li> 
        </p>

        <h3>Types of Chemical Reactions</h3>
        <ul>
            <h4>Combination Reaction </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> In this type of chemical reaction two reactants react with each other to form a product. Generally these reactions are exothermic as they release the
                    energy in surrounding. For example when we mix quick lime(Cao) in water it reacts vigorously and produces Slaked lime with the release of heat.
                    So this is a combination reaction.</li>
                <li> Cao + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + Heat. Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> is the substance which was used extensively in older homes in the place of paint </li>
                <li> It is that due to which the clothes got whitened  </li>
                <li> When it is kept in open air especially CO<sub>2</sub> it gets harder.</li>
                <li> Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CacO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O </li>
            <li><strong>Decomposition Reaction:</strong> A compound breaks into simpler substances.</li>
            <li><strong>Displacement Reaction:</strong> A more reactive element displaces a less reactive one.</li>
            <li><strong>Double Displacement Reaction:</strong> Ions are exchanged between reactants.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions:</strong> Oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>Exothermic Reactions:</strong> Release heat, e.g., combustion.</li>
            <li><strong>Endothermic Reactions:</strong> Absorb heat, e.g., photosynthesis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Effects of Oxidation in Everyday Life</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Corrosion:</strong> Slow degradation of metals (e.g., rusting of iron).</li>
            <li><strong>Rancidity:</strong> Oxidation of fats and oils in food items.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Preventive measures for corrosion and rancidity include painting, greasing, airtight storage, 
            and adding antioxidants.
        </p>

        <h3>Practice Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Define a chemical reaction and list its characteristics.</li>
            <li>What is a balanced chemical equation? Why should chemical equations be balanced?</li>
            <li>Explain oxidation and reduction with examples.</li>
        </ul>
