        <h2>Chapter 2: Acid Bases and Salts </h2>

        <p>
            CBSE Class 10 Science Notes Chapter 2 <strong>Acid Bases and Salts </strong> 
            provides a concise summary for quick revision. Key points include characteristics of acidsand 
            Bases, characteristics of chemical reactions of acid and bases , and salts formed and also the importance of pH. 
        </p>

        <h3>Acid </h3>
        <p><li>Taste sour and change blue litmus paper to red.</li>
<li>Highly reactive with metals and release hydrogen gas. </li>
<li>Common acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), and acetic acid (CH₃COH)</li>
<li> Definition : Acids are that compounds which releases H<sup>+</sup> ions on hydrolysis or reaction with water. </li>
          <li>Acid solution conducts electricity as they release ions which are essential for conduction of electricity.</li>
          Now Acids are of mainly two types - 
          <li>(i) Natural Acids: Acids which are obtained from natural sources are called Natural Acids or Organic Acids.
Examples:
Methanoic acid (HCOOH)
Acetic acid (CH3COOH)
Oxalic acid (C2H2O4) etc.</li>
          <li>(ii) Mineral Acids: Acids that are prepared from minerals are known as Mineral Acids Example; Inorganic acids, man-made acids or synthetic acid are also known as Mineral Acids.
Example:
Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
Sulphuric acid (H2SO4)
Nitric acid (HNO3)
Carbonic acid (H2CO3)
Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) etc.</li>
          <h4>Chemical of reaction of acids </h4>
          <h5> Reaction of acid with metal </h5>
          <li>Acids give hydrogen gas along with respective salt when they react with a metal.
<li>Metal + Acid → Salt + Hydrogen</li>
Examples:
<li>Hydrogen gas and zinc chloride are formed when hydrochloric acid reacts with zinc metal.</li>
 <p class="reaction">Zn + HCl &rarr; ZnCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> </p>
      <h5>Reaction of acid with metal carbonates </h5>
      <li>Acids give carbon dioxide gas and respective salts along with water when they react with metal carbonates.</li>
<li>Metal carbonate + Acid → Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water</li>
Examples:
<li>Hydrochloric acid gives carbon dioxide gas, sodium chloride along with water when reacts with sodium carbonate.</li>
      <p class="reaction"> Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> &rarr; NaCl + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
      <h5>Reaction of acids with metal hydrogencarbonate </h5>
      <li>Acids give carbon dioxide gas, respective salt and water when they react with metal hydrogen carbonate.</li>
<li>Acid + Metal hydrogen carbonate → Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water </li>
Example:
<li>Sulphuric acid gives sodium sulphate, Carbon dioxide gas and water when it reacts with sodium bicarbonate.</li> 
<p class="reaction"> NaHCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>S +CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
  
        </p>
        <ul>
            <h3>Bases</h3>
          <p>
        <li>Tastes bitter and change red litmus paper to blue. </li>
            <li>Usually used to form soaps. </li>
            <li>Common bases include sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, milk of magnesia, potassium hydroxide etc. </li>
            <h4>Reactions of Bases </h4>
           <h5> Reaction of Bases with metals </h5>
            <li> Bases also form salt and hydrogen gas when they reacts with metal. But there are some metals which don't react with bases like gold, silver etc. </li>
            <li> Base + Metal &rarr; Salt + Hydrogen gas</li>
            <li> When sodium hydroxide reacts with Zinc it forms Sodium zincate and Hydrogen gas </li>
            <p class="reaction">2NaOH + Zn &rarr; Na<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub></p>
          <h5>Reaction of Bases with metal carbonates </h5>
        <li> Generally bases don't react with metal carbonates are also basic. </li>
        <li>We have provided the table for the nature of metal or non metal oxide carbonates etc. Go and checkout the table as it will help in the reactions. </li>
          Same with hydrogen carbonates. 
          <h4> Extras </h4>
          <h5> Acids + Metallic Oxide &rarr; Salt + Water </h5>
          <h5> Bases + Metallic Oxides &rarr; No reaction </h5> 
            <li> Except when bases react with the amphoteric metal oxides as they are both acidic and basic in nature. </li>
            <h5> Acid + Non Metallic Oxide &rarr; No reaction </h5>
             <h5> Bases + Non Metallic Oxide &rarr; Salt + Water</h5>
            Know more about it. 
          </p>

        <h3>How Acids and Bases react with each other </h3>
        <li> When Acid and Base react with each other.,they Neutralise each others effect and convert the solution to neutral only when where acid and base are equally powerful. This is called neutralisation reaction and it also involves the release of heat. </li>
        <p class="reaction"> NaOH + HCl &rarr; NaCl+ H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
              <h3>What makes an Acid an Acid and a Base a Base? </h3>
            <li> Now all the compounds which are acidic, the factor that would be common between them is the release of H<sup>+</sup> ions when they react with water. </li>
            <li> Now the Base have the same thing but the different ion. The bases release OH<sub>-</sub> ion in the presence of water. </li>
            <li> Due to this properties of Acids and Base, they are able to conduct electricity due to the presence of ions. </li>
            <li> Now ethanol also whose chemical formula ends with OH don't conduct electricity because it don't get electrolysed to release any ion. </li>
            <li> For example when diluted Sulphuric acid is added to Sodium Chloride HCl gas is produced and when we will test it by a litmus paper there wouldn't be any change but if we add some water to it, it will turn the blue litmus paper to red. So the acid only shows their properties when they are reacted with water. </li>
            <p class="reaction"> HCl + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup></p>
           <p class="reaction">H<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> </p>
            <li>Same with NaOH </li>
            <p class="reaction"> NaOH + H<sub>2</sub> &rarr; Na<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup> </p>
              <li>Now all Bases do not dissolve in water like Cuo but the soluble ones are called Alkali. Alkali are soapy to touch, bitter in taste and corrosive in nature. Examples are Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Hydroxide etc. are Alkali. </li>
            

        <h3>Practice Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Define a chemical reaction and list its characteristics.</li>
            <li>What is a balanced chemical equation? Why should chemical equations be balanced?</li>
            <li>Explain oxidation and reduction with examples.</li>
        </ul>

Types of Acids: Acids are divided into two types on the basis of their occurrence i.e., Natural acids and Mineral acids.
(i) Natural Acids: Acids which are obtained from natural sources are called Natural Acids or Organic Acids.
Examples:
Methanoic acid (HCOOH)
Acetic acid (CH3COOH)

Sulphuric acid (H2SO4)
Nitric acid (HNO3)
Carbonic acid (H2CO3)
Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) etc.

Chemical Properties of Acid:
(i) Reaction of acids with metal: Acids give hydrogen gas along with respective salt when they react with a metal.
Metal + Acid → Salt + Hydrogen
Examples:

Test For Hydrogen Gas: The gas evolved after reaction of acid with metal can be tested by bringing a lighted candle near it. If the gas bums with a pop sound, then it confirms the evolution of hydrogen gas. Burning with pop sound is the characteristic test for hydrogen gas.


(ii) Reaction of acids with metal carbonate: Acids give carbon dioxide gas and respective salts along with water when they react with metal carbonates.
Metal carbonate + Acid → Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water
Examples:
Hydrochloric acid gives carbon dioxide gas, sodium chloride along with water when reacts with sodium carbonate.

Sulphuric acid gives calcium sulphate, carbon dioxide gas, calcium sulphate and water when it reacts with calcium carbonate
Acids Bases and Salts Class 10 Notes Science Chapter 2 img-4
Nitric acid gives sodium nitrate, water and carbon dioxide gas when it reacts with sodium carbonate.
Acids Bases and Salts Class 10 Notes Science Chapter 2 img-5

(iii) Reaction of acid with hydrogen carbonates (bicarbonates): Acids give carbon dioxide gas, respective salt and water when they react with metal hydrogen carbonate.
Acid + Metal hydrogen carbonate → Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water
Example:
Sulphuric acid gives sodium sulphate, Carbon dioxide gas and water when it reacts with sodium bicarbonate.
Acids Bases and Salts Class 10 Notes Science Chapter 2 img-6


Test For Evolution of Carbon Dioxide Gas: Carbon dioxide turns lime water milky when passed through it. This is the characteristic test for carbon dioxide gas.
The gas evolved because of reaction of the acid with metal carbonate or metal hydrogen carbonate turns lime water milky. This shows that the gas is carbon dioxide gas. This happens because of the formation of a white precipitate of calcium carbonate.
Acids Bases and Salts Class 10 Notes Science Chapter 2 img-7
But when excess of carbon dioxide is passed through lime water, it makes milky colour of lime water disappear. This happens because of formation of calcium hydrogen carbonate. As calcium hydrogen carbonate is soluble in water, thus, the milky colour of solution mixture disappears.




CBSE Notes Class 10 Science Chapter 2 - Acids Bases and Salts
Acids and bases are like the dynamic duo of chemistry! Acids release hydrogen ions (H⁺) in water, have a sour taste, a pH below 7, and turn blue litmus paper red. Bases release hydroxide ions (OH⁻), have a bitter taste, a pH above 7, and turn red litmus paper blue. Both react to form salts and water in neutralization reactions. Examples include HCl (acid) and NaOH (base). Let’s understand acids, bases and salts in detail. 



Class 10 Science Chapter 2 Revision Notes: 



Properties of Acids and Bases
Acids:

Taste sour and change blue litmus paper to red.
Highly reactive with metals and release hydrogen gas.
Common acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), and acetic acid (CH₃COOH).
Bases:

Taste bitter and feel slippery.
Change red litmus paper to blue and are less reactive with metals than acids.
Examples include sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂), and ammonia (NH₃).
What are Salts and How are They Formed?
Salts are ionic compounds composed of positive ions (cations) from a base and negative ions (anions) from an acid. The formation of salts occurs through the neutralization reaction between an acid and a base.

Common Reactions Involving Acids and Bases
Neutralization: 
Acid + Base → Salt + Water 

e.g., HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O

Reaction with Metals: 
Acid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen Gas 

e.g., 2HCl + Zn → ZnCl₂ + H₂

Reaction with Carbonates: 
Acid + Carbonate → Salt + Water + Carbon Dioxide 

e.g., 2HCl + CaCO₃ → CaCl₂ + H₂O + CO₂

Dissociation of Acids and Bases in Water
Acids:

Strong Acids (e.g., HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃) almost completely dissociate in water, releasing a high concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺), which results in a highly acidic solution.
Weak Acids (e.g., CH₃COOH) partially dissociate, releasing fewer hydrogen ions into the solution.
Bases:

Strong Bases (e.g., NaOH, KOH) fully dissociate in water, releasing a large number of hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution highly basic.
Weak Bases (e.g., NH₃) dissociate partially, producing fewer hydroxide ions in the solution.
Measuring the Strength of Acid or Base Solutions
The strength of acid or base solutions is typically measured using the pH scale:

pH Scale: Ranges from 0 to 14, where 7 is neutral (pure water). pH values less than 7 indicate acidic solutions, while values greater than 7 indicate basic solutions. The closer the pH is to 0, the stronger the acid; the closer the pH is to 14, the stronger the base.
pOH Scale: Similarly, the pOH of a solution is another scale used to measure the alkalinity of a solution. Just like the pH scale, a lower pOH means a stronger base.
Concentration: The concentration of H⁺ ions in an acidic solution or OH⁻ ions in a basic solution also indicates strength. This is often expressed in moles per liter (Molarity).
Common salt
The common salt we use every day is a key ingredient for making various products like sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing soda, and bleaching powder. Let's explore how this one substance can create so many different compounds in brief-
